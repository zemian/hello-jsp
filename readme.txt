# A java8 based JSP webapp (servlet 3.1)

This is a maven based project that will build a war file. You would need to create and setup a
Servlet WebServer (eg: Tomcat 8.5) to deploy this war file to see result.

For IDE (IntelliJ), you may create a Tomcat Server and then run it with this project deploy
to run inside IDE. This setup would allow you to set breakpoint to debug.
